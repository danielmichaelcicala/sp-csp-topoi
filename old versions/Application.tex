Let's recast the 
reachability problem 
of Petri nets
as a question about 
2-cells.
First, we realize
a marked Petri net $P$
as a 1-cell in 
$\cat{MonSp(Csp(C))}$
for a suitable category $\cat{C}$.
Note, this realization
is inspired by the fact 
that a marked Petri net 
can be thought of as a multiset.

Let $P_S$ be the set of species
for $P$.  A marking of $P$ is a
map $m \from X \to P_S$ for some
finite set of tokens $X$. 

Since $\cat{FinSet}$ is a topos
and topoi are closed under
taking slice categories,
we can consider the bicategory
$\cat{MonSp ( Csp ( FinSet / P_S ) ) }$.
Call this $\cat{B}$ for short.
To refresh your memory,
this is the bicategory 
[finite sets over $P_S$,
cospans of finite sets over $P_S$,
monic spans of cospans of finite sets over $P_S$]

We are interested in the hom-category 
$\cat{B}( \emptyset , \emptyset )$,
where $\emptyset$ is taken over $P_S$
in the only way possible.
This category is just
[ finite sets over $P_S$,
 monic spans of finite sets over $P_S$ ]
But a finite set over $P_S$, 
say $f \from X \to P_S$, 
is really a multiset where
$s \in P_S$ has multiplicity
$| f^{-1} ( s ) |$.
We want spans of finite sets over $P_S$ 
to correspond to a transformation
from one marking of $P_S$ to another.
So the entire structure of 
$\cat{B}( \emptyset , \emptyset )$
is giving us the collection of 
all markings of $P_S$ for objects
and allowing any marking to
be transformed into any other marking,
which is clearly not what we want.
So we should consider a subcategory
corresponding to the trasitions
of the Petri net $P$.

Here's an illustration.  
Consider the Petri net $P$
 \[
 \begin{tikzpicture}
 \draw  (-0.6,0.6) ellipse (0.4 and 0.4);
 \draw  (-0.6,-0.8) ellipse (0.4 and 0.4);
 \draw  (2.6,-0.2) ellipse (0.4 and 0.4);
 \draw  (0.8,0.2) rectangle (1.2,-0.4);
 \node (v1) at (-0.2,0.4) {};
 \node (v2) at (0.8,0) {};
 \node (v3) at (-0.2,-0.8) {};
 \node (v4) at (0.8,-0.2) {};
 \node (v5) at (1.2,-0.2) {};
 \node (v6) at (2.2,-0.2) {};
 \draw [->] (v1) edge (v2);
 \draw [->] (v3) edge (v4);
 \draw [->] (v5) edge (v6);
 \node at (-1.2,1.2) {A};
 \node at (-1,-1.4) {B};
 \node at (2.4,0.4) {C};
 \node at (1,0.6) {T};
 \end{tikzpicture}
 \]
We have species $A,B,C$ and 
transitition $T$. 
All the possible markings
of $P$ are given by maps
$f \from X \to \{A,B,C\}$ where 
$X$ is some finite set
of tokens and the number
of tokens in, say, $A$ is $ |f^{-1} (A)|$.
The transition we have takes
an $A$ token and a $B$ token 
and turns it to a $C$ token.  
We can think of this like a span
\[
	\{A,B\} \gets \emptyset \to \{C\}.
\]
This translates into the 
bicategory by looking at the 
hom-category
$ \cat{B} ( \emptyset , \emptyset ) $
with all objects, the cospans
\[
	\emptyset \gets X \to \emptyset
\]
for finite sets $X$ over $P_S$ 
(corresponding to all possible markings)
and a single generating morphism
(corresponding to the single 
transition $T$)
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (v1) at (-1,-2.2) {$\emptyset$};
\node (v2) at (0.2,-1) {\{A,B\}};
\node (v3) at (0.2,-2.2) {$\emptyset$};
\node (v4) at (0.2,-3.4) {\{C\}};
\node (v5) at (1.4,-2.2) {$\emptyset$};
\draw [->]  (v1) edge (v2);
\draw [->] (v1) edge (v3);
\draw [->] (v1) edge (v4);
\draw [->] (v5) edge (v2);
\draw [->] (v5) edge (v3);
\draw [->] (v5) edge (v4);
\draw [->] (v3) edge (v2);
\draw [->] (v3) edge (v4);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

So the reachability problem
is reduced to asking whether
a certain span of cospan exists.

Natural questions are what other
hom-categories correspond to 
in this context. 
I think it fixes a number of tokens
that cannot be transfered
under any rewriting.  
So it seems like something
of a context in which
a rewrite can happen.  
But a bit more subtle
than this too, so 
it's worth some thought.
